  abstract = {This essay discusses the effect of technical change on wage inequality. I argue that the behavior of wages and returns to schooling indicates that technical change has been skill-biased during the past sixty years. Furthermore, the recent increase in inequality is most likely due to an acceleration in skill bias. In contrast to twentieth-century developments, much of the technical change during the early nineteenth century appears to be skill-replacing. I suggest that this is because the increased supply of unskilled workers in the English cities made the introduction of these technologies profitable. On the other hand, the twentieth century has been characterized by skill-biased technical change because the rapid increase in the supply of skilled workers has induced the development of skill-complementary technologies. The recent acceleration in skill bias is in turn likely to have been a response to the acceleration in the supply of skills during the past several decades.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US  employment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor---the task content of production. Automation, which  enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result,  automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced  by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because  of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production---due to automation  and new tasks---can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is  accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in  previous decades.},

Within five years of the appointment of a business manager, wages decline by 6\% and the labor share by 5 percentage points in the US, and by 3\% and 3 percentage points in Denmark. Firms appointing business managers are not on differential trends and do not enjoy higher output, investment, or employment growth thereafter. Using manager retirements and deaths and an IV strategy based on the diffusion of the practice of appointing business managers within industry, region and size quartile cells, we provide additional evidence that these are causal effects. We establish that the proximate cause of these (relative) wage effects are changes in rent-sharing practices following the appointment of business managers. Exploiting exogenous export demand shocks, we show that non-business managers share profits with their workers, whereas business managers do not. But consistent with our first set of results, these business managers show no greater ability to increase sales or profits in response to exporting opportunities. Finally, we use the influence of role models on college major choice to instrument for the decision to enroll in a business degree in Denmark and show that our estimates correspond to causal effects of practices and values acquired in business education--rather than the differential selection into business education of individuals unlikely to share rents with workers.},

  abstract = {In conventional economic theory the state and subsidiary institutions are viewed as instruments that largely evolve in conformity with the efficiency needs of the market economy in response to the level and changes in prices and incomes, tastes, endowments, and technology. Institutional change is thereby endogenized and does not have an independent impact on economic change. Therefore, the conventional wisdom pays little heed to institutional change or institutional details, because of the implicit assumption that institutions adapt to the efficiency needs of the economy, where this adaptation process goes largely unexplained. In the alternative theory presented here, extending and revising the conventional wisdom, institutional change plays a fundamental role in determining the content and direction of economic change. Institutional change is only partially endogenized and rational decision makers can construct sustainable institutions which need not be efficient. Efficiency, inclusive of optimal or frontier-based technological change, can be achieved only on very specific circumstances. The latter requires a more comprehensive understanding of the role which private property rights, human rights, political power, bargaining power, and preference formation, and preferences play in determining the content and direction of institutional change. This complex dialectical relationship relates to what Allan Schmid (2004) refers to as the Value Circularity Problem. The perspective articulated in the alternative theory fits nicely into the world view of institutional economics articulated by Schmid (2004, 2007) wherein it is important build upon the contemporary economic wisdoms, amending extant theory when necessary, to better explain socioeconomic reality so as to better inform institutional choice and the socio-economic consequences of institutional choice and change.},

  abstract = {The process of industrialization is typically associated with urbanization and a widening urban-rural skills gap. To what extent were these disparities driven by the direct impact on occupational attainment of living in an urban area or the result of the positive self-selection of more-skilled individuals into cities? In this paper, we leverage exceptional Swedish longitudinal data that allow us to estimate the impact of rural-urban migration on skill attainment during Sweden's industrialization from the 1880s to the 1930s using a staggered treatment difference-in-difference estimator. We attribute roughly half of the gap in urban-rural skills to a direct impact of living in an urban area, whereas the other half is driven by self-selection into cities. A third of the direct impact of residing in cities is explained by a static effect, reflecting better initial matching, while the rest is the result of a dynamic effect as individuals upgrade their skills over time in urban areas. We conclude that cities had a substantial effect on skill development in Sweden around the turn of the nineteenth century that is likely to extend to other European and North American economies that were industrializing around the same time.},

We contend that computer capital (1) substitutes for a limited and well-defined set of human activities, those involving routine (repetitive) cognitive and manual tasks; and (2) complements activities involving non-routine problem solving and interactive tasks. Provided these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the task content of employment, which we explore using representative data on job task requirements over 1960 -- 1998. Computerization is associated with declining relative industry demand for routine manual and cognitive tasks and increased relative demand for non-routine cognitive tasks. Shifts are evident within detailed industries, within detailed occupations, and within education groups within industries. Translating observed task shifts into educational demands, the sum of within-industry and within-occupation task changes explains thirty to forty percent of the observed relative demand shift favoring college versus non-college labor during 1970 to 1998, with the largest impact felt after 1980. Changes in task content within nominally identical occupations explain more than half of the overall demand shift induced by computerization.},

  abstract = {US cities today are vastly more educated and skill-intensive than they were five decades ago. Yet, urban non-college workers perform substantially less skilled jobs than  decades earlier. This deskilling reflects the joint effects of automation and, secondarily, rising international trade, which have eliminated the bulk of non-college  production, administrative support, and clerical jobs, yielding a disproportionate polarization of urban labor markets. The unwinding of the urban non-college  occupational skill gradient has, I argue, abetted a secular fall in real non-college wages by: (1) shunting non-college workers out of specialized middle-skill occupations  into low-wage occupations that require only generic skills; (2) diminishing the set of non-college workers that hold middle-skill jobs in high-wage cities; and (3)  attenuating, to a startling degree, the steep urban wage premium for non-college workers that prevailed in earlier decades. Changes in the nature of work---many of  which are technological in origin---have been more disruptive and less beneficial for non-college than college workers.},

The nuance of economic understanding has improved across these epochs. Yet, traditional economic optimism about the beneficent effects of technology for productivity and welfare has eroded as understanding has advanced. Given this intellectual trajectory, it would be natural to forecast an even darker horizon ahead. I refrain from doing so because forecasting the ``consequences'' of technological change treats the future as a fate to be divined rather than an expedition to be undertaken.

The pre-industrial period (1750--1850) is for the first time examined for Sweden at the national level. The study uses a random sample of probate inventories from urban and rural areas across the country, adjusted for age and social class. Estimates are provided for the years 1750, 1800, 1850, and 1900. The results show a gradual growth in inequality as early as the mid-eighteenth century, with the sharpest rise in the late nineteenth century. Whereas the early growth in inequality was connected to changes in the countryside and in agriculture, the later growth was related to industrialization encompassing both compositional effects and strong wealth accumulation among the richest. The level of inequality in Sweden in 1750 was lower than for other western European countries, but by 1900 Sweden was just as unequal.},

  abstract = {During the twentieth century, Sweden became known as a country with an unusually egalitarian distribution of income and wealth, an encompassing welfare state, and an exceptionally strong social democracy. It is commonplace among historians and social scientists to consider these equal outcomes of the twentieth century as the logical end result of a much longer historical trajectory of egalitarianism, from early modern free peasant farmers or from a peculiar Swedish political culture that was egalitarian and consensus-oriented. This article questions the Swedish interpretation of Sonderweg. In 1900, Sweden had some of the most unequal voting laws in western Europe, and more severe economic inequality than the United States. This throws the purported continuity from early modern equality to social democratic equality into question. The roots of twentieth-century Swedish egalitarianism lie in exceptionally well-organized popular movements after 1870, with a strong egalitarian counter-hegemonic culture and unusually broad popular participation in politics.},

  abstract = {Much of the income equalization that took place during the first half of the twentieth century  was driven by shifts in the shares of the incomes of the rich, such as the top 1 percent. But the  available studies using tabulated data have not been wholly able to account for the relative decline in top earners' incomes. In this paper, we present the first evidence on the composition of the top groups from the Belle Epoque to the early post-WW2 period. Using information on 21,055 individual tax-payers in two elite areas in greater Stockholm, we show  that the absolute top stratum (the richest 0.1 percent) was dominated by an economic elite of  CEOs and bankers, while a remarkably large fraction of the top 1 percent consisted of professionals such as medical doctors and engineers. There was a distinction within the elite between capital-rich ``rentiers'' and those affluent whose income came from wages and business. The incomes of the top stratum were built on the ownership or leadership of companies producing mass consumption goods, machinery, or banking and insurance. We relate the peak of income inequality in the first quarter of the twentieth century to the historical circumstances of a globalized economy with growing mass markets in all the  industrializing countries. These circumstances, jointly with an economic policy that was still  relatively laissez faire allowed great fortunes to be accumulated. In the 1920s and 1930s policy turned away from globalization and to stronger regulation, at the same time as steeper  competition and growing unionization undermined the super profits of the previous quarter- century. Increased state interventionism in the economy and an expansive education policy also undermined the high relative incomes of professionals; we document the declining advantages of professions such as medical doctors, pharmacists, and lawyers when compared  with the average income throughout the period.},

Over the twentieth century, we find little evidence of convergence in town populations, despite the railroad network expanding further to connect nearly all towns.

I estimate the extent of factor bias within industries and countries using a 19-country panel of manufacturing data covering the 1980s. Estimates using both production functions and total factor productivity functions show that technological change is strongly biased against less-skilled workers and toward both skilled workers and capital. An industry or country with twice the capital and skill per less-skilled worker enjoys 1.4\%-1.8\% faster total factor productivity growth annually due to the effects of factor-bias. These results are consistent with the empirical literature on skill-biased technological change. They may well explain why conditional convergence' of per capita income across countries is so slow.},

We argue that there is a frequent mismatch between the aim of the quantile regression analysis and the quantitative toolkit used in much of the applied literature, including the motherhood wage penalty literature. This mismatch may result in wrong conclusions being drawn from the data, and in the end, misguided theories. In this paper, we clarify the crucial conceptual distinction between influences on quantiles of the overall distributions, which we term population-level influences, and individual-level QTEs. Further, we use data simulations to illustrate that various classes of quantile regression models may, in some instances, give entirely different conclusions (to different questions). Finally, we compare quantile regression estimates using real data examples, showing that UQR and QTE models differ sometimes but not always. Still, the conceptual and empirical distinctions between quantile regression models underline the need to match the correct model to the specific research questions. We conclude the paper with a few practical guidelines for researchers.},

In many situations, clean tuples must match acceptable tuples in reference tables. For example, product name and description fields in a sales record from a distributor must match the pre-recorded name and description fields in a product reference relation.A significant challenge in such a scenario is to implement an efficient and accurate fuzzy match operation that can effectively clean an incoming tuple if it fails to match exactly with any tuple in the reference relation. In this paper, we propose a new similarity function which overcomes limitations of commonly used similarity functions, and develop an efficient fuzzy match algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by evaluating them on real datasets.},

First, it describes the extraordinary transformation the British economy experienced between 1760 and 1850. In these years Britain moved from being a largely self-sufficient, self-sustaining, and still principally agrarian society, to being an economy where a substantial fraction of food, raw materials and energy was imported, or mined from the earth as coal, and where the great majority of the population was engaged in industry and commerce. But second, and more importantly, it has come to mean the general move in the world economy in about 1800 from the pre-industrial economy, which experienced extremely low rates of efficiency growth, to the modern economy, where efficiency growth is rapid and persistent. That shift from low rates of efficiency advance to rapid rates had nothing inherently to do with industry or industrialization. Efficiency advance in agriculture has been as rapid as in the rest of the economy since 1800. So for the more general use of the term `Industrial Revolution' the `industrial' component is a misnomer, but a misnomer that we have to live with.},

The second is to show that the wars can be one of principal sources of path-breaking technologies that support Long Waves for the technological, economic and social change over the long run. As a matter of fact, a fundamental problem in the field of economic growth is how LWs emerge and sustain economic and social change. The vast literature has analyzed several characteristics and factors of LWs. However, the root causes of LWs are hardly known. This study shows that the possible sources of LWs are due to structural change of major warfare that generate General Purpose Technologies and clusters of innovation for technological, economic and social change over time. In fact, the war is a major agent of change that generates both huge demand-side effects with expansionary policies and powerful supply-side effects based on learning by doing in strategic productions, spin-off and technological spillover from military R\&D (period of the ``creative destruction''). In particular, major wars generate clusters of new technology (in troughs of LWs) that support the subsequent recovery-prosperity phase of LWs with new radical and incremental innovations, their commercial introduction, and widespread adoption in markets. These main factors drive the evolution of LWs and generate technological, productivity and economic growth in society over the long run. Overall, then, the main aim of this study is to clarify, whenever possible one of main driving forces of LWs and economic change in society.},

The key idea is that a set of locations can characterize the joint dependence between their corresponding observations. Locations provide a structure analogous to that provided by the time index in time series models. For example, near observations may be highly correlated but, as distance between observations grows, they approach independence. However, while time series are ordered in a single dimension, spatial processes are almost always indexed in more than one dimension and not ordered. Even small increases in the dimension of the indexing space permit large increases in the allowable patterns of interdependence between observations. The primary benefit of this modelling strategy is that complicated patterns of interdependence across sets of observations can be parsimoniously described in terms of relatively simple and estimable functions of objects like the distances between them.},

The manual work involved in processing and classifying occupational descriptions is error-prone, tedious, and time-consuming. We finetune a preexisting language model (CANINE) to do this automatically, thereby performing in seconds and minutes what previously took days and weeks. The model is trained on 14 million pairs of occupational descriptions and HISCO codes in 13 different languages contributed by 22 different sources. Our approach is shown to have accuracy, recall, and precision above 90 percent. Our tool breaks the metaphorical HISCO barrier and makes this data readily available for analysis of occupational structures with broad applicability in economics, economic history, and various related disciplines.},

We show that between 1997 and 2001 there was a growth in Britain in the utilisation of computing skills, literacy, numeracy, technical know-how, high-level communication skills, planning skills, client communication skills, horizontal communication skills, problem-solving, and checking skills. Computer skills utilisation was growing the fastest, and the use of computers was becoming more sophisticated. We re-evaluate the issue of whether computers have affected wages, taking into account existing critiques in the literature. We find that both computer skills and high-level communication skills carry positive wage premia, as shown both in cross-section hedonic wage equations that control for many detailed activities, and through a within-cohorts change analysis.

In this paper, development blocks are identified by means of a combination of co-integration analysis and Granger causality. Using these techniques, we are able to identify two partially overlapping development blocks in the Swedish economy, formed around the electricity generating sector: one with metal, metal goods, machinery and railways; and another with pulp and paper, chemicals, and machinery.},

Williamson discussed the development of regional disparities over time using quantitative indicators for several countries and suggested that the long-term evolution of regional disparities followed an inverted U-shape curve, with rising regional inequality during industrialization and decreasing inequality thereafter. There are few empirical descriptions of the regional character of Sweden's industrialization in the longer term, but some previous studies cover certain periods of regional economic conditions. The empirical evidence suggests some distinct tendencies over the last 140 years of spatial economic evolution in Sweden. The first growth regime from 1860 until the Baring crisis of 1890 is clearly an era of increased market integration.},

It studies the co-location of industries to look for evidence of labour pooling, input sharing and knowledge spillovers. The novel contribution of the article is that it estimates single-industry models using a common empirical framework that exploits the cross-sectional variation in how one industry co-locates with the other industries in the economy. This unified approach yields evidence on the relative importance of the Marshallian microfoundations at the single-industry level, allowing for like-for-like cross-industry comparisons on the determinants of agglomeration. Using UK data, we estimate such microfoundation models for 97 manufacturing sectors, including the classic agglomeration cases of automobiles, computers, cutlery and textiles. These four cases---as with all of the individual industry models we estimate---clearly show the importance of the Marshallian forces. However, they also highlight how the importance of these forces varies across industries---implying that extrapolation from cases should be viewed with caution. The article concludes with an investigation of the pattern of heterogeneity. The degree of an industry's clustering (localisation), entrepreneurship, incumbent firm size and worker education are shown to contribute to the pattern of heterogeneous microfoundations.},

Despite some recent innovations, much empirical work continues to rely on measures of 'average' or 'non-upper tail' human capital such as literacy and years of schooling. We thus turn to perhaps unique sources from Denmark and Norway. From the early nineteenth century until after the Second World War, these countries had the tradition of publishing biographies of all high school graduates, usually 25 and 50 years after graduation. These were effectively mini-CVs covering entire careers, including work positions, travel, achievements, and more. We discuss these sources and their potential for furthering our understanding of the role of upper tail knowledge and human capital for development. Source criticism reveals strengths and weaknesses, but importantly confirms promising perspectives for improving the measurement of upper tail knowledge.},

As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity over the long run, but the immediate consequences of mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more effectively face the present.},

But starting in the early 1980s the labor market premium to skill rose sharply and by 2005 the college wage premium was back at its 1915 level. The twentieth century contains two inequality tales: one declining and one rising. We use a supply-demand-institutions framework to understand the factors that produced these changes from 1890 to 2005. We find that strong secular growth in the relative demand for more educated workers combined with fluctuations in the growth of relative skill supplies go far to explain the long-run evolution of U.S. educational wage differentials. An increase in the rate of growth of the relative supply of skills associated with the high school movement starting around 1910 played a key role in narrowing educational wage differentials from 1915 to 1980. The slowdown in the growth of the relative supply of college workers starting around 1980 was a major reason for the surge in the college wage premium from 1980 to 2005. Institutional factors were important at various junctures, especially during the 1940s and the late 1970s.},

The paper explains how the ongoing Digital Revolution is characterized by a complex interplay between worker skills and digital capital in the workplace, and consequent changes in job mobility for workers and in output prices affecting consumer demand for goods and services. In particular, it explains how current worker{\^a}{\texteuro}``technology interactions and the equilibrium effects they entail combine to create economy-wide job polarization with winners and losers from ongoing technological progress.

I bring this possibility into focus through the lens of a historical episode from the 19th century, when colluding railroads in the U.S. South converted 13,000 miles of railroad track to standard gauge over the course of two days in 1886, integrating the South into the national transportation network. Route-level freight traffic data reveal that the gauge change caused a large shift in market share from steamships to railroads, but did not affect total shipments or prices on these routes. Guided by these results, I develop a model of compatibility choice in a collusive market and argue that collusion may have enabled the gauge change to take place as it did, while also tempering the effects on prices and total shipments.

The displacement effect on the labor market caused by the introduction of new technologies has triggered a major debate on the impact of technological change on the labor market, whether or not it leads to polarization of employment and wages. In addition, the introduction of new machines has transformed how production and work are organized, their social and cultural characteristics, and the way they interact with the institutional framework.

The first paper conducts an explorative study of the Swedish labor markets between 1870 and 1930. By employing tabulated population censuses and utilizing the HISCLASS scheme for skill classification, I demonstrate that, at the aggregate level, the Swedish population indeed shifted from unskilled to more-skilled occupations. Occupational upgrading was notably more pronounced for women compared to men, with a significant number of women leaving agriculture for skilled service jobs. Within the manufacturing sector, employment shifted from medium-skilled to low- and unskilled occupations. Thus, I propose that the shift from agriculture to services played a more important role in the aggregate skill upgrading in Sweden than the shift from agriculture to industry. The second paper investigates how industrialization and technological change impact the skill premium. Using income tax registry data to construct a series of occupational incomes between 1900 and 1950, the study challenges the expectation of a rising skill premium associated with skill-biased technologies like electricity. Despite rapid technological change, the skill premium decreased, largely because of the faster income growth of low- and unskilled production workers compared to high- and medium-skilled white-collar workers. In the third paper, in collaboration with Svante Prado and Yoshihiro Sato, we explore the association between mechanization and female and child employment. Drawing on an establishment-level survey from 1879, we show that establishment size is positively associated with the employment of women and children, and that the effect of mechanization is likely mediated through establishment size.  Finally, the fourth paper, co-authored by Svante Prado, shows that the widespread electrification of Swedish industry was in general positive for labor. Using establishment-level data from industrial surveys, we show that electricity use is positively associated with higher employment and wages. Furthermore, establishments that adopted electricity during our study period increased their employment and wages more rapidly than those that did not adopt electricity.},

New technologies may replace human workers, but can simultaneously create jobs if workers are needed to use these technologies or if new economic activities emerge. Furthermore, technology-driven productivity growth may increase disposable income, stimulating a demand-induced expansion of employment. To synthesize the existing knowledge on this question, we systematically review the empirical literature on the past four decades of technological change and its impact on employment, distinguishing between five broad technology categories (ICT, Robots, Innovation, TFP-style, Other). Overall, we find across studies that the labor-displacing effect of technology appears to be more than offset by compensating mechanisms that create or reinstate labor. This holds for most types of technology, suggesting that previous anxieties over widespread technology-driven unemployment lack an empirical base, at least so far. Nevertheless, low-skill, production, and manufacturing workers have been adversely affected by technological change, and effective up- and reskilling strategies should remain at the forefront of policy making along with targeted social support systems.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility has become a requirement in the hard sciences, and its adoption is gradually extending to the digital humanities. The FAIR criteria and the publication of data papers are both indicative of this trend. However, the question that arises is whether the strict prerequisites of digital reproducibility serve only to exclude digital humanities from broader humanities scholarship. Instead of adopting a binary approach, an alternative method acknowledges the unique features of the objects, inquiries, and techniques of the humanities, including digital humanities, as well as the social and historical contexts in which the concept of reproducibility has developed in the human sciences. In the first part of this paper, I propose to examine the historical and disciplinary context in which the concept of reproducibility has developed within the human sciences, and the disciplinary struggles involved in this process, especially for art history and literature studies. In the second part, I will explore the question of reproducibility through two art history research projects that utilize various computational methods. I argue that issues of corpus, method, and interpretation cannot be separated, rendering a procedural definition of reproducibility impractical. Consequently, I propose the adoption of `post-computational reproducibility', which is based on FAIREST criteria as far as digital corpora are concerned (FAIR\,+\,Ethics and Expertise, Source mention\,+\,Time-Stamp), but extended to include further sources that confirm computational results with other non-computational methodologies.},

Many argue that the experience of early British industrialization supports the thesis that economic advances depend on specialized scientific training, the acquisition of costly human capital, and the role of elites. This paper examines the contributions of different types of knowledge to industrialization, by assessing the backgrounds, education and inventive activity of major contributors to technological advances in Britain during the crucial period between 1750 and 1930. The results indicate that scientists, engineers or technicians were not well-represented among the cadre of important British inventors, and their contributions remained unspecialized until very late in the nineteenth century. The informal institution of apprenticeship and learning on the job provided effective means to enable productivity and innovation. For developing countries today, the implications are that costly investments in specialized human capital resources might be less important than incentives for creativity, flexibility, and the ability to make incremental adjustments that can transform existing technologies into inventions and innovations that are appropriate for prevailing domestic conditions.},

  abstract = {Evaluating technology transfer outcomes from governmet supported research, development and demonstration (RD \& D) projects is complicated by the variety of paths through which technology can move from producer(s) to user(s). Using a set of 31 cases studies of RD\&D projects the processes of technology transfer and `technology absorption' are examined. Technology transfer is the use by a party external to the project of the technology or technical information outputs. Technology absorption is defined as the use by contractors, sub-contractors or co-sponsors participating in the RD\&D project. This is a rarely studied phenomenon but one especially important for technology policies. The case analysis confirmed the value of viewing transfer and absorption as separate processes with separate determinants. Absorption is a more robust process stimulated by a variety of factors. Transfer is more delicate, thwarted not only by market barriers, but also coordination problems, conflicts, and resource constrains among project members. Using models of the transfer and absorption processes a typology of transfer outcomes is created. `On-the-shelf' projects (12 cases) were those in which no transfer or absorption impacts occurred. These projects involved large numbers of actors assisting a small private producer/contractor who was dependent upon outside resources for completing the project. While a surprising amount effort was made to transfer these outcomes the efforts failed. `Absorption' projects (eight cases) were those in which technology was absorbed but not transferred. Absorption occurred both by design and by default. `Market-induced' projects (four cases) were those were technology was transferred but not absorbed. These cases also involved small private producers but they experienced less project interdependence and were marketing to niches created}

The articles provide complementary insights on cross-cutting themes of technological unemployment, wage inequality and job polarization. They also highlight often conflicting views about technology ownership, work-less utopia, education reforms and the imperative of human-centricity in appropriation of technology. Drawing on the findings across the whole spectrum of theoretical and analytical perspectives, we offer critical reflections about the factors that will define the work of the future, in terms of skills, creativity and opportunities for autonomous workers. We also discuss the political and institutional processes that will shape the future of work. Finally, we offer recommendations for future research and policy interventions.},

  abstract = {This book addresses a long-standing problem faced by researchers using occupational information from historical sources in different countries: how to make effective comparisons between nations and across regional boundaries. Occupational data are routinely employed by historians and other social scientists to investigate past patterns and processes of economic and social life. Occupations are in many senses the best, and in some cases the only, available indicators of human capital, industrial development and social structure among national historical populations. Yet some of the most interesting and important questions in fields informed by the history of work, such as mobility research, demography, or the study of labour markets, are comparative ones. Is there, for example, a shared underlying dynamic to modern societies, which makes them more open and wealthier than their predecessors? Up to now, such questions have been difficult to address on the basis of historical evidence because of the variations in meaning within occupational terminology across both time and space. HISCO offers a solution to this problem, providing a common, cross-national, language-sensitive, coding scheme that can accommodate historical occupational titles of the kind found in documents ranging from state censuses to parish records. The HISCO scheme is based on the International Labour Organisation's ISCO68 classification, thereby also facilitating comparison between historical and contemporary datasets. The ISCO68 scheme was adapted and transformed into HISCO by a team of native-speaking, national specialists in work history using large-scale databases from Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, which together span the period 1690-1970. In addition to an occupational classification system that organises job titles according to tasks performed, HISCO includes three subsidiary classifications, allowing researchers to take account of any additional information recorded about an individual's status, relationship to the labour market, or the products he or she made and traded. The HISCO book includes a language-based, alphabetical coding index, which shows the - sometime multiple - options available to researchers seeking to place a particular title or description. One particular advantage of this book, designed to assist users who prefer not to begin the coding process with the index, is that all examples of titles from the datasets used to create the scheme are also included under the headings and definitions of the HISCO groups. The classification scheme itself is preceded by chapter which explains the principles underpinning HISCO and outlines the provenance, character and historical background of the international occupational data used to create it.},

Furthermore, it is linked to an international standard classification scheme for occupations--HISCO.The chapters in the book show how historical occupational titles classified in HISCO can form the building blocks of a social class scheme for past populations. The dimensions underlying classes are discussed. How, for instance, can manual work be distinguished from nonmanual work? Skilled from nonskilled? And what did "supervision" really mean? A rich source of detailed occupational information is used to measure those dimensions. The result is an instrument that can be used to systematically compare social class positions, distilled from a dazzling variety of occupational titles, around the world and over a range of periods.},

  abstract = {The GRADE-CERQual (`Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research') approach provides guidance for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from systematic reviews of qualitative research (or qualitative evidence syntheses). The approach has been developed to support the use of findings from qualitative evidence syntheses in decision-making, including guideline development and policy formulation. Confidence in the evidence from qualitative evidence syntheses is an assessment of the extent to which a review finding is a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. CERQual provides a systematic and transparent framework for assessing confidence in individual review findings, based on consideration of four components: (1) methodological limitations, (2) coherence, (3) adequacy of data, and (4) relevance. A fifth component, dissemination (or publication) bias, may also be important and is being explored. As with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach for effectiveness evidence, CERQual suggests summarising evidence in succinct, transparent, and informative Summary of Qualitative Findings tables. These tables are designed to communicate the review findings and the CERQual assessment of confidence in each finding. This article is the first of a seven-part series providing guidance on how to apply the CERQual approach. In this paper, we describe the rationale and conceptual basis for CERQual, the aims of the approach, how the approach was developed, and its main components. We also outline the purpose and structure of this series and discuss the growing role for qualitative evidence in decision-making. Papers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in this series discuss each CERQual component, including the rationale for including the component in the approach, how the component is conceptualised, and how it should be assessed. Paper 2 discusses how to make an overall assessment of confidence in a review finding and how to create a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. The series is intended primarily for those undertaking qualitative evidence syntheses or using their findings in decision-making processes but is also relevant to guideline development agencies, primary qualitative researchers, and implementation scientists and practitioners.},

This research reviews the PSM literature, develops a procedure for applying the PSM to estimate the causal effects of intervention, elaborates on the procedure using an empirical example, and discusses the potential application of the PSM in different management fields. The implementation of the PSM in the management field will increase researchers' ability to draw causal inferences using observational data sets.},

The estimates are based on enrolment in different forms of education, stretching as far back as 1812, and the size and age distribution of the population within age range 15--65~years. The secular accumulation of human capital has closely matched the long-term trend in aggregate productivity and both grew at a rate of 2.4\% annually. Our estimates differ significantly from the data attributed to Sweden in the international short-cut estimates of human capital for the period since 1960. The basic question addressed is about causality: whether human capital causes economic growth or if causality goes in the other direction. We address this problem with modified Granger-causality tests. According to our results, changes in the stock of human capital have in a systematic way preceded changes in aggregate productivity up to the structural crisis in the 1970s. This allows us to conclude that human capital has been a causal factor in Swedish economic growth since the industrialisation. However, after 1975, the growth of human capital has not been able to match the demands of the third industrial revolution.},

Industrialization -- i.e., technological development -- did not take place at the same rate and at the same time in every country, and neither did it in all the regions of the same country. In the course of this chapter, we show how the new economic geography (NEG) literature makes it possible to identify a number of elements that are essential for understanding this reality. This line of research provides an economic foundation for the existence of a relationship between the economic development processes and the advance of production sectors characterized by the presence of economies of scale (i.e., manufacturing), market integration, and the genesis of an unequal distribution of economic activity across the territory. The NEG literature thus considers that the inequality that today characterizes the most developed economies has its roots in the early stages of their economic development processes, brought about almost 200 years ago by the technological change typical of the first and second Industrial Revolutions and the integration of the national markets. In other words, we show how the connection between economic history and economic geography contributes not only to a better understanding of the geography of the historical industrialization processes but also to the identification of the elements that explain the current unequal economic geography of the world.},

Several criticisms of the monopolistic modelling logic of NEG have come from economic geography schools of thought as well as from orthodox and heterodox schools of economics. These critiques focus variously on the immeasurability of notions of increasing returns, the static nature of assumptions, the specific focus on the representative firm, the presence only of pecuniary economies and the absence of either human capital or technological spillovers as externalities. However, advocates of the new economic approaches argue that their analyses provide insights into spatial economic phenomena which were previously unattainable under the existing analytical frameworks. In this chapter we reflect on these developments, putting equal weight on both conceptualisations, set off against a historical review of agglomeration and regional economic growth theories.},

  abstract = {To understand the corporate performance of Japanese firms in the twentieth century, we have constructed a comprehensive database that includes asset, capital composition, profitability, and other variables relating to corporate governance structure. In this paper, we briefly introduce our project and report preliminary results of research on corporate performance and its determinants. We surveyed the long-term transition of ROA (defined as the ratio of profit after tax reduction to total assets) and its standard deviation using micro data of Japanese firms through the twentieth century, and investigate the effect of corporate governance structure (large shareholder and main bank) and the role of corporate groups (zaibatsu and keiretsu) on ROA and its volatility. Preliminary results show that high ROA with high volatility characterized the performance of large firms in the prewar period, while relatively low profitability with less volatility characterized the post-war era. In the 1990s, however, Japanese corporations showed extraordinarily low levels of performance with high volatility. The large shareholder enhanced firm performance in the prewar period. In contrast, zaibatsu did not enhance their affiliates' performance, nor did keiretsu and the main bank in the postwar period. Keiretsu group affiliation increased growth at the expense of profitability in the postwar period. Finally, zaibatsu in the prewar, and the main bank and keiretsu system in the postwar period both reduced the volatility of performance. This stabilizing effect was partly brought about by risk or profit sharing, and partly by strict monitoring (zaibatsu) and rent extraction (main bank). The main bank system and keiretsu systems lost the ability to reduce the volatility of performance in the 1990s.},

  abstract = {Technology is widely considered the main source of economic progress, but it has also generated cultural anxiety throughout history.  The developed world is now suffering from another bout of such angst.  Anxieties over technology can take on several forms, and we focus on three of the most prominent concerns.  First, there is the concern that technological progress will cause widespread substitution of machines for labor, which in turn could lead to technological unemployment and a further increase in inequality in the short run, even if the long-run effects are beneficial.  Second, there has been anxiety over the moral implications of technological process for human welfare, broadly defined.  While, during the Industrial Revolution, the worry was about the dehumanizing effects of work, in modern times, perhaps the greater fear is a world where the elimination of work itself is the source of dehumanization.  A third concern cuts in the opposite direction, suggesting that the epoch of major technological progress is behind us.  Understanding the history of technological anxiety provides perspective on whether this time is truly different.  We consider the role of these three anxieties among economists, primarily focusing on the historical period from the late 18th to the early 20th century, and then compare the historical and current manifestations of these three concerns.},

The technology that created the great inventions was driven by a combination of pathbreaking ideas and the dexterity and skills of trained artisans. While those forms of human capital were quite different, they both came out of small elites of intellectuals and craftsmen, what are rapidly becoming known as ``upper-tail human capital.'' I analyze the institutions that drove the incentives for both, and show that they came together to produce the Great Enrichment. These incentives were both material and social: between 1500 and 1700, the search for financial security and reputation cooperated in producing a unique institutional environment in which the elites in Western Europe produced the three legged-stool of European modernity: the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment.

In this article, I present new estimates of women's labour force participation rate between 1870 and 1960, the time when the country shifted from a predominantly agrarian economy to an industrial and services-based society. The revised data give a very different pattern from existing series; I find that female participation displays a clear U-shape: falling from the late nineteenth century,reaching a trough in the 1940s, and then starting to rise from the 1960s. Falling employment in agriculture was not balanced out by expanding opportunities in manufacturing, but women's gainful employment started expanding as the white-collar services sector grew and women's education increased - following the pattern set out by Goldin's theory of the U-curve. The male breadwinner period was short and less pronounced in Sweden than in most other countrieshowever. Participation among adult women in the late nineteenth century was above 55 percent, and never fell below 40 percent at the lowest point. My findings lend support to the idea that the dual-earner model of present-day Sweden could be the outcome of a longer historical trajectory.},

The second is that all new automations are adopted and the third is that the share of labor does not converge to zero in the long run.

In our experiment, a third of the houses in a town were covered by lava. People living in these houses were much more likely to move away permanently. For the dependents in a household (children), our estimates suggest that being induced to move by the ``lava shock'' dramatically raised lifetime earnings and education. While large, these estimates come with a substantial amount of statistical uncertainty. The benefits of moving were very unequally distributed across generations: the household heads (parents) were made slightly worse off by the shock. These results suggest large barriers to moving for the children, which imply that labour does not flow to locations where it earns the highest returns. The large gains from moving for the young are surprising in light of the fact that the town affected by our volcanic experiment was (and is) a relatively high income town. We interpret our findings as evidence of the importance of comparative advantage: the gains to moving may be very large for those badly matched to the location they happened to be born in, even if differences in average income are small.},

  abstract = {Peaks and troughs in the spatial distributions of population, employment and wealth are a universal phenomenon in search of a general theory. Such spatial imbalances have two possible explanations. In the first one, uneven economic development can be seen as the result of the uneven distribution of natural resources. This is sometimes called `first nature' and refers to exogenously given characteristics of different sites. However, it falls short of providing a reasonable explanation of many other clusters of activities, which are much less dependent on natural advantage. The aim of geographical economics is precisely to understand what are the economic forces that, after controlling for first nature, account for `second nature', which emerges as the outcome of human beings' actions to improve upon the first one. Specifically, geographical economics asks what are the economic forces that can sustain a large permanent imbalance in the distribution of economic activities. In this paper, we focus on the so-called `new economic geography' approach. After having described some of the main results developed in standard location theory, we use a unified framework to survey the home market effect as well as core--periphery models. These models have been criticized by geographers because they account for some spatial costs while putting others aside without saying why. Furthermore, core--periphery models also exhibit some extreme features that are reflected in their bang--bang outcomes. We thus move on by investigating what the outcomes of core--periphery models become when we account for a more complete and richer description of the spatial aspects that these models aim at describing. We conclude by suggesting new lines of research.},

The purpose of this planned investigation will be to fill a gap in Danish historiography, but also to contribute to the wider literature about the role of education and practice in innovation with empirical evidence, and by further developing concepts of knowledge and technology.},

The practice draws on a variety of industries, from electronics to eyewear, from furniture to mechatronics, in a range of economies including Europe, the USA and China.The eminent contributors investigate how the latest technologies diffuse through the economy, helping to reinvigorate seemingly old and stagnant industries in the process. Examples drawn from Asia and Europe show how countries like China and India are increasingly able to catchup with, or even surpass, industrialized nations in Europe and North America, in some cases by becoming technological pioneers. The book also examines the effects of new information and communications technologies on regional economies, especially in Western Europe. The themes and findings are summarized and evaluated in an extensive introductory chapter.Scholars of innovation from a variety of disciplines, including management, economics, and human resources will find this study insightful. Postgraduate students in industrial studies, industrial dynamics and industrial development, including both advanced and industrialising countries, will also find much of interest to them in this timely book.},

The distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a nonrival, partially excludable good. Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth.},

LLM-based synthetic data build on fundamentally different epistemological assumptions than previous synthetically generated data and are justified by a different set of considerations. In this essay, we explore the various ways in which LLMs have been used to generate research data and consider the underlying epistemological (and accompanying methodological) assumptions. We challenge some of the assumptions made about LLM-generated data, and we highlight the main challenges that social sciences and humanities need to address if they want to adopt LLMs as synthetic data generators.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that the quality of employment---whether workers are employed in `good jobs'---is an important aspect of wellbeing, and constructs an index to measure historical occupational quality. The paper begins by explaining why work quality should be included as a measure of living standards. It describes the literature on present-day job quality, the `work gap' in our knowledge of historical wellbeing, and uses historical workers' perspectives about the aspects of jobs they valued to derive components of job quality in the past. It then suggests sources that provide information about the components, outlines how to measure the components and combine them in a Historical Occupational Quality Index (HOQI), and sets out the analytical narrative approach to describe work-related wellbeing that underpins quantification. The HOQI enables comparisons of job quality across time and space using many types of historical evidence. The second half of the paper applies the index to the mechanization of spinning in Britain during the late 18th and early 19th century. The paper combines data on hand spinning wages from Humphries \& Schneider (2020) with a new dataset of more than 5000 observations of wages and working time in the early factory system and extensive qualitative evidence. Most spinning jobs changed from low-pay, high-control, low-risk work to higher-paid but low-control and more dangerous occupations. The best factory jobs, with high pay, control, and lower occupational risks, were claimed by men, which produced male-biased technological change. The case study illustrates how job quality measurement enables systematic analysis of non-wage dimensions of wellbeing. It also shows that these components of good work became more unequal during the First Industrial Revolution. The paper concludes by suggesting further possible applications of the HOQI.},

Some reasons for the importance of electricity are quite obvious. Due to her natural resources, Sweden had at an early stage developed many energy intensive industries such as iron and steel works and pulp and paper mills. She lacked, however, deposits of fossil fuels while the supply of water power was abundant. Hence, early on there was a strong stimulus to develop a system of generation and transmission of electrical power as well as to invest in electrotechnical equipment. Similarly, there was a strong stimulus to the development of a domestic electrotechnical engineering industry. This industry became a backbone of the more sophisticated manufacturing that spurred Swedish industrialization from the 1890s onwards.},

To resolve this puzzling contrast, we differentiate average human capital (literacy) from upper-tail knowledge. As a proxy for the historical presence of knowledge elites, we use city-level subscriptions to the famous Encyclop{\'e}die in mid-18th century France. We show that subscriber density is a strong predictor of city growth after the onset of French industrialization. Alternative measures of development such as soldier height, disposable income, and industrial activity confirm this pattern. Initial literacy levels, on the other hand, are associated with development in the cross-section, but they do not predict growth. Finally, by joining data on British patents with a large French firm survey from the 1840s, we shed light on the mechanism: upper-tail knowledge raised productivity in innovative industrial technology.},

The results of this study support some stylized facts about innovational interdependencies in general-purpose technologies: a closely knitted set of industries have provided positive and negative driving forces for the development of ICT innovations. The historical evolution of the GPT surrounding microelectronics can in this perspective be described as a sequence of development blocks.},

This study explores the promise of a literature-based innovation output indicator, constructed for the Swedish engineering industry, 1909-2016. The findings suggest a long-run increasing trend in innovations per capita. Meanwhile, product innovations have also become more complex and it is suggested that crude innovation counts underestimate the long-run innovation performance. In order to analyse innovation and economic development across different frequencies, the study uses a wavelet decomposition approach. The results suggest that innovation activity has surged in periods of intense industry rationalization and struc- tural crisis (1930s, 1970s and 2010s) and that such pulses were intimately connected to the second and third industrial revolutions.},

  abstract = {There are fundamental unresolved questions about the nature of the long-run interplay between innovation and economic development processes. This study examines technological transitions in Sweden, 1908--2016, using a new literature-based innovation output indicator for the engineering industry, allowing a mixed-methods approach. The results suggest that waves of innovation have taken place during periods of investment downturns and structural crises during the 1930s, 1970s, and 2010s. Closer examination indicates that landscape pressure alone cannot explain the pattern. Rather, the pattern can be explained by multi-regime interactions: infrastructure and industry rationalization, acting as a fertile ground for breakthrough innovations when the crisis breaks out. The results support a historical interpretation of long-run transitions in terms of development blocks and three industrial revolutions, with implications for the assessment of current sustainable transitions. This suggests a crucial role for infrastructures and interactions between socio-technical systems, not least between digital and renewable energy technology.},

  abstract = {The implications of technology adoption for productivity, income, and welfare have been studied widely in the context of less developed countries (LDCs). In contrast, the relationship between technology adoption and employment has attracted less interest. This systematic review evaluates the diverse yet sizeable evidence base that has remained below the radars of both reviewers and policy makers. We map the qualitative and empirical evidence and report that the effect of technology adoption on employment is skill biased and more likely to be observed when technology adoption favors product innovation as opposed to process innovation. Technology adoption is also less likely to be associated with employment creation when: (i) the evidence is related to farm employment as opposed to firm/industry employment; (ii) the evidence is related to low-income countries as opposed to lower middle-income or mixed countries; and (iii) the evidence is based on post-2001 data as opposed to pre-2001 data. There is also qualitative evidence indicating that international trade, weak forward and backward linkages, and weaknesses in governance and labor-market institutions tend to weaken the job-creating effects of technology adoption. We conclude by calling for compilation of better quality survey data and further attention to sources of heterogeneity in modeling the relationship between technology adoption and employment in LDCs.},

  abstract = {Why did England industrialize first? And why was Europe ahead of the rest of the world? Unified growth theory in the tradition of Galor and Weil (2000, American Economic Review, 89, 806--828) and Galor and Moav (2002, Quartely Journal of Economics, 177(4), 1133--1191) captures the key features of the transition from stagnation to growth over time. Yet we know remarkably little about why industrialization occurred much earlier in some parts of the world than in others. To answer this question, we present a probabilistic two-sector model where the initial escape from Malthusian constraints depends on the demographic regime, capital deepening and the use of more differentiated capital equipment. Weather-induced shocks to agricultural productivity cause changes in prices and quantities, and affect wages. In a standard model with capital externalities, these fluctuations interact with the demographic regime and affect the speed of growth. Our model is calibrated to match the main characteristics of the English economy in 1700 and the observed transition until 1850. We capture one of the key features of the British Industrial Revolution emphasized by economic historians --- slow growth of output and productivity. Fertility limitation is responsible for higher per capita incomes, and these in turn increase industrialization probabilities. The paper also explores the availability of nutrition for poorer segments of society. We examine the influence of redistributive institutions such as the Old Poor Law, and find they were not decisive in fostering industrialization. Simulations using parameter values for other countries show that Britain's early escape was only partly due to chance. France could have moved out of agriculture and into manufacturing faster than Britain, but the probability was less than 25\%. Contrary to recent claims in the literature, 18th century China had only a minimal chance to escape from Malthusian constraints.},
