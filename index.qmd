:::{.notes}

So why do we care about Sweden as a case study when we think about technological transformations? 


there are at least two reasons; 1 - Sweden was a fast adopter of electricity. After Jonas Wenström discovered three phase current in the late 19th century, Sweden rapidly electrified - with the electrification of rural areas advancing rapdily between 1900 and 1921, when the Western line - an important part of the grid, was completed. 

Second, Sweden in the early 20th century was undergoing a levelling in terms of inequality; we can see that the share of income going to to the top decile of the income distribution declined - so it is an intersting time with a great levelling taking place. 

Further, electrification as a general purpose technology drastically changed that way that we worked and lived; agricultural tasks that used to be very labour intensive were mechanised and then electrified, freeing up labour to move in to factories - which also were completely transformed by the electric motor, improving the quality of the jobs in the factory compared to the risks of belt drives from a central drive shaft, and allowing modular factory production, running only some machines at a time.

## Why did Sweden become rich?

To answer the question of why Sweden became rich, we need to use source material from the time.

## Who is who?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

Vem är Vem? is a **Swedish biographical encyclopedia** that was published in two editions of five volumes each in 1945–1950 and 1962–1968 by Bokförlaget Vem är Vem.

The intention was, according to the publishers, to draw attention **to people who were at the height of their activities**, even if they were younger, in influential or otherwise noted positions in different areas.

- Biographies and career trajectories of ~ 75,000 individuals!

- 8 of the 10 volumes are digitized by librarians in Uppsala – thank you <3
